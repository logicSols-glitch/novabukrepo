# NovaBuk Node.js Backend - Beginner's Step-by-Step Setup Guide

**Welcome! Don't worry - we'll walk through this together. Just follow each step carefully.**

---

## Step 0: What is Node.js?

Before we start, here's what's happening:
- **Node.js** = JavaScript that runs on your computer (not in a browser)
- **Backend** = The part that runs on your computer, stores data, and makes decisions
- **Frontend** = What users see (HTML, CSS, JavaScript in browser)
- **MongoDB** = A database (like a filing cabinet) that stores all your blog posts

Think of it like a restaurant:
- Frontend = The menu that customers see
- Backend = The kitchen where food is prepared
- Database = The storage freezer with ingredients

---

## Step 1: Install Node.js (REQUIRED FIRST)

### On Windows:

1. Go to **https://nodejs.org** in your browser
2. Click the **LTS** (Long Term Support) button - this is the stable version
   - At the time of writing, it's version 20.x or 22.x
3. Click **Download** and run the installer
4. Go through the installation (just keep clicking **Next**, don't change anything)
5. When it finishes, click **Finish**

### Verify Installation:

1. Press **Windows Key** + **R**
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter (this opens Command Prompt)
3. Copy and paste this command:
   ```
   node --version
   ```
4. Press Enter

**If you see a version number (like `v20.10.0`), you're good! ✓**

---

## Step 2: Install MongoDB

Choose **ONE** option:

### Option A: Easy Way (Recommended for Beginners) - MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)

**MongoDB Atlas is like using Google Drive instead of a folder on your computer**

1. Go to **https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas**
2. Click **Sign Up** and create a free account
3. After logging in, click **Create a New Project**
4. Name it `novabuk-blog` and click **Create Project**
5. Click **Create a Deployment** (under "Build a Database")
6. Choose **Free Tier** and click **Create**
7. For "Authentication Method", click **Username and Password**
8. Enter these details:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123` (just for development, change in production!)
   - Click **Autogenerate Secure Password** OR keep the one I gave you
9. Click **Create User**
10. For "IP Address", click **Add My Current IP Address** then **Finish and Close**
11. Click **Drivers** tab
12. Copy the **connection string** (it looks like: `mongodb+srv://admin:password@cluster...`)
13. **Save this somewhere** - we'll need it soon!

### Option B: Local Way (Harder, but no internet needed)

Download and install MongoDB Community Edition:
- Go to **https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community**
- Download the installer for Windows
- Run it and click through the setup
- Keep clicking **Next** and let it install

**If you use this option, your connection string is just:**
```
mongodb://localhost:27017/novabuk-blog
```

---

## Step 3: Set Up Backend (The Important Part)

### 3.1 Open Command Prompt

1. Press **Windows Key** + **R**
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. You should see a black window with something like `C:\Users\YourName>`

### 3.2 Navigate to Your Project

Copy this command exactly and paste it in Command Prompt:

```
cd C:\Users\IDOKO NELSON EHI\Desktop\NOVABUK\first\backend
```

Press Enter. You should now see:
```
C:\Users\IDOKO NELSON EHI\Desktop\NOVABUK\first\backend>
```

### 3.3 Install Dependencies

Copy and paste this command:

```
npm install
```

This will show lots of text. **Don't worry!** It's downloading all the tools we need. Wait for it to finish (about 1-2 minutes).

When it's done, you should see `added XXX packages` and no red errors.

---

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

**This tells our backend WHERE to find the database and what secret code to use**

### 4.1 Locate the .env.example File

In your `backend` folder, you should see a file called `.env.example`

### 4.2 Copy It

1. Right-click on `.env.example`
2. Click **Copy**
3. Right-click in empty space in the same folder
4. Click **Paste**
5. You get a new file - rename it to `.env` (remove the `.example` part)

### 4.3 Edit the .env File

1. Right-click on your new `.env` file
2. Click **Open with** > **Notepad**
3. You should see something like:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/novabuk-blog
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_change_this
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

### 4.4 Update MongoDB Connection

**If you used MongoDB Atlas (Cloud option):**

1. Replace the `MONGODB_URI=...` line with your connection string from Step 2
2. It should look like:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:admin123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/novabuk-blog
   ```

**If you used Local MongoDB:**

Leave it as is:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/novabuk-blog
```

### 4.5 Save the File

1. Press **Ctrl** + **S**
2. Close the file

✓ **Done! The backend now knows where the database is.**

---

## Step 5: Start the Backend Server

### 5.1 In Command Prompt (from Step 3.2)

Make sure you're in the backend folder. You should see:
```
C:\Users\IDOKO NELSON EHI\Desktop\NOVABUK\first\backend>
```

Copy and paste this:

```
npm run dev
```

Press Enter.

### 5.2 Wait for This Message:

You should see something like:
```
🚀 NovaBuk Blog Backend running on http://localhost:5000
✓ MongoDB Connected Successfully
```

**If you see this, YOUR BACKEND IS RUNNING! 🎉**

**Important:** Keep this Command Prompt window OPEN. If you close it, the backend stops.

**Note:** If you see an error about MongoDB, check:
- Did you use the correct connection string in `.env`?
- Is MongoDB Atlas accepting your IP address?
- For local MongoDB, is MongoDB running?

---

## Step 6: Create Your First Admin Account

### 6.1 Open Admin Dashboard

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
2. Copy and paste this address in the URL bar:

   ```
2. Press Enter

### 9.2 You Should See

- The blog post you just created!
- It should show the title, excerpt, author, read time
- Click on it to read the full post

**CONGRATULATIONS! Your backend is working! 🎉**

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start / MongoDB Connection Error

**Problem:** You see `MongoDB Connection Error` or `ECONNREFUSED`

**Solution:**
1. **If using MongoDB Atlas:**
   - Check your connection string in `.env` is correct
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas website
   - Click "Clusters" → "Connect" → Check your IP is whitelisted
   - Verify username and password are correct

2. **If using Local MongoDB:**
   - Make sure MongoDB is installed
   - On Windows, MongoDB might run automatically, but check:
     - Press `Windows Key`, search for "Services"
     - Look for "MongoDB Server" and make sure it's "Running"

### Admin Dashboard Shows Blank Page

**Problem:** Page is white or empty

**Solution:**
1. Open browser **Developer Console:**
   - Right-click on page
   - Click "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
   - Click "Console" tab
   - Look for red errors
2. Most likely issue: Backend isn't running
   - Go back to Command Prompt
   - Make sure you see the "🚀 Backend running" message
   - If not, run `npm run dev` again

### Can't Find Admin Dashboard File

**Problem:** File:/// URL doesn't work

**Solution:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\IDOKO NELSON EHI\Desktop\NOVABUK\first\main\`
3. Find `admin-dashboard.html`
4. Right-click it
5. Click "Open with" → Choose your browser

### Blog Posts Don't Show Up

**Problem:** Blog page is empty or shows "No blog posts yet"

**Solution:**
1. Check you published the blog (not just saved as draft)
2. In Dashboard, look at the blog you created
3. Make sure the "Published" toggle is ON (green)
4. Refresh the blog page (press F5)

## Keeping Your Backend Running

**Important:** The Command Prompt with the backend MUST stay open:

- ❌ **Don't close the black Command Prompt window**
- ✓ **Keep it running while you work**
- ✓ **Minimize it to the taskbar if you want it out of the way**

If you close it, the backend stops and your website won't work.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Location |
|--------|----------|
| **Start Backend** | Command Prompt: `npm run dev` in `backend` folder |
| **Login/Create Blog** | Open `admin-dashboard.html` in browser |
| **View Published Blogs** | Open `blog-dynamic.html` in browser |
| **Read Full Blog Post** | Click any blog on `blog-dynamic.html` |
| **Edit Blog Configuration** | Edit `.env` file in `backend` folder |

## Next Steps (After Everything Works)

Once you confirm everything is working:

1. **Add more blog posts** - use the admin dashboard
2. **Customize blog details** - edit the model in `backend/models/Blog.js`
3. **Style the pages** - edit CSS files
4. **Deploy online** - see Deployment section in main README.md

## Questions?

If something isn't working:

1. Check you followed every step
2. Look at the error message in Command Prompt
3. Check the browser console (right-click → Inspect → Console)
4. Make sure backend is still running (Command Prompt shows no errors)
